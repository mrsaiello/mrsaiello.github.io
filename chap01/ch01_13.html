<h1>Networks</h1>
<A NAME="network"></A>
<p>
A computer <b>network</b> consists of two or more computers connected
so that they can exchange data and programs.
When a computer is a member of a network,
the programs it runs and the data it uses can be on the hard disk
of some other computer on the network.
In business and industrial settings,
most computers are on a network.
The operating system that runs on a networked computer
must manage its share of the network 
(along with managing all its other responsibilities).
The operating system is able to find programs and data that
are stored on other network computers,
and copy them into its own main memory.
</p>

<A NAME="local area network"></A>
<p>
In a <b>local-area network</b> only a few dozen computers
are connected together, 
usually all located within the same building.
Each computer has a <b>network address</b> that the
other computers use to access it.
Usually the computers share a printer.
There may be an especially powerful computer
called a <b>server</b> whose hard disk holds
all the application programs and data that the other
computers are expected to need.
</p>

<p>
Each computer in a network has a <b>network interface card</b> in its systems unit.
This is an input/output device that sends and receives data over cables.
The network interface cards of computers on a network 
are connected together with cables.
