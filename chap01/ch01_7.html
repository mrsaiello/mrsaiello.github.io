<h1>Secondary Memory</h1>
<A NAME="hard disk"></A>
<A NAME="file"></A>
<p>
Secondary memory is where programs and data are kept on a long-term basis.
Common secondary storage devices are the hard disk and floppy disks.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The hard disk has enormous storage capacity compared to main memory.</li>
<li>The hard disk is usually contained in the systems unit of a computer.</li>
<li>The hard disk is used for long-term storage of programs and data.</li>
<li>Data and programs on the hard disk are organized into files.
    <ul>
    <li>A <b>file</b> is a named
    section of the disk.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<A NAME="gigabyte"></A>
<p>
A hard disk might have a storage capacity of 250 gigabytes.
This is about 400 times the amount of storage in main memory.
A hard disk is slow compared to main memory.
If the processor interacted with it directly 
the entire computer system would slow down.
The reason for having two types of storage is this contrast:

<table class="layout">
<tr><th>Primary memory</th><th>Secondary memory</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>
    <ol>
    <li>Fast</li>
    <li>Expensive</li>
    <li>Low capacity</li>
    <li>Works directly with the processor</li>
    </ol>
</td>

<td>
    <ol>
    <li>Slow</li>
    <li>Cheap</li>
    <li>Large capacity</li>
    <li>Not connected directly to the processor</li>
    </ol>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<A NAME="floppy disk"></A>
<p>
Floppy disks are mostly used for transferring 
software between
computer systems 
and for casual backup of software.
They have low capacity, and are very, very slow
compared to other storage devices.
