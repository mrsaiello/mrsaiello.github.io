<h1>Wide-Area Networks</h1>
<A NAME="wide area network"></A>
<A NAME="IP address"></A>

<p>
Large organizations need to connect many more computers than
can be handled with a local area network.
A <b>wide-area network</b> can connect thousands of
computers together over great distances.
The long distance connections are made by
using  optical fiber,
telephone lines, microwave radio,
and satellite communications.
Each computer in the network has
a network address (as with local-area networks)
to uniquely identify it.
</p>

<p>
Wide-area networks use a variety of special
hardware to manage the flow of data.
When two computers share data,
this hardware makes it appear that the two
computers are connected together directly.
In reality,
there may be dozens of network devices 
between the two computers.
</p>

<p>
All these devices use the same method for
dealing with data.
Without a common method of dealing with data,
a large network would become a hopeless muddle.
An agreement about how to represent and transmit
data over a network is called a <b>protocol</b>.
Usually large networks use a protocol called
TCP/IP (for transmission control protocol / internet protocol).
