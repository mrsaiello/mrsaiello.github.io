<h1>Software</h1>

<A NAME="software"></A>

<p>
Computer software consists of both <em>programs</em> and <em>data</em>.
Programs are lists of instructions for the processor.
Data can be any information that a program needs:
character data, numerical data, image data, audio data, 
and countless other types.
The distinction between programs and data is not 
as clear-cut as you might think, however.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Fundamental Idea:</b> Both programs and data are 
saved in computer memory in the same way.
The electronics of computer memory 
(both main memory and secondary memory)
make no distinction between programs and data.
</blockquote>


<p>
The insight that both programs and data can be saved using the same
electronic methods is one of the most important ideas in computer science.
Computer systems can use their memory for whatever needs arise.
