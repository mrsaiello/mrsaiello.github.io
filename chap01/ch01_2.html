<h1>Hardware and Software</h1>
<p>
In thinking about  <em>Monsters, Inc.</em>,
you are thinking about intangible infomation.
You can't grab it and throw it against a wall,
or break it in half,
or weight it on a scale.
It does not have a physical existence.
You might have a VCR tape with <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> recorded on it.
The tape is physical, but the movie itself is intangible infomation.
When you speak of the movie,
you usually mean the intangible movie, 
not a particular tape that has a record of it.
</p>

<p>
The TV set you use to watch <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> is tangible.
It has a physical existence.
You can weigh it on a scale,
you can throw it against a wall,
you can break it in half,
you can pound it to pieces with a hammer
(and your grades might improve if you do).
</p>
 
<p>
The word <em>hardware</em> is used for devices such as TV
sets and VCR tapes that have a physical existence.
The word <em>software</em> is sometimes used for 
movies, music, novels, computer programs and data,
and similar intangibles
(although sometimes people use "software" only for
computer programs and data).
</p>

<p>
TV sets are useful because  they combine the
tangible (the TV set itself) and the intangible (TV programs).
Computer systems are useful in the same way&#8212;they
combine  tangible hardware components and intangible software components.
