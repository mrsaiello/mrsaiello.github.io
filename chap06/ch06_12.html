<h1>Finished Program</h1>
<p>
Here is the completed program.
Be sure that you put the quote marks where they belong.
If you forget just one of them,
the compiler will become confused
and would not translate your program!
</p>

<pre class="code">
class Haiku
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    System.out.println(<span class="blue">"On a withered branch"</span>);
    System.out.println(<span class="blue">"A crow has just alighted:"</span>);
    System.out.println(<span class="blue">"Nightfall in autumn."</span>);
  }
}
</pre>


<A NAME="spaces in source code"></A>
<p>
If you have been creating the example programs 
and compiling and running them,
you may have noticed that <em>spaces</em> and <em>new lines</em>
in the program are not critical.
(However, you can't put spaces in the middle of a word, and spaces inside the
quote marks do matter.)
For example,
the following version of the program will compile correctly and will do
exactly the same thing when it is run:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  class     Haiku{
  public   static void main(String[] args )
    {
  System.out.   println(<span class="blue">          "On a withered branch"</span>);
    System  .  out.println(<span class="blue">"A crow has just alighted:"</span>         );
System.out.println(<span class="blue">"Nightfall in autumn."</span>);
  }}
</pre>

<p>
The compiler does not "see" the two dimensional lay-out of the program.
It regards the program as a stream of characters, one following the other.
</p>

<p>
However, humans are sensitive to the lay-out of text, and it is important
to be neat and consistent when you create a source file.
Although the second version of the program runs correctly,
it is much harder for a person to understand.

<h3> QUESTION 12:</h3>
<p>
If there were a slight mistake in the poorly laid-out program, would it be easy to find?
