<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
No.  Everything is so confused, a slight mistake is easily overlooked.

<div class="lesson">
<h1>Comments</h1>
<A NAME="comments"></A>
<p>
A <b>comment</b>  is a note written to a human reader of a program.
A comment starts with the two characters "<code>//</code>" (slash slash).
Those characters and everything that follows them 
on that one line are ignored by
the java compiler.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="green">// Write three lines of a poem to the computer monitor</span>
class Haiku
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    System.out.println("On a withered branch" );
    System.out.println("A crow has just alighted:");
    System.out.println("Nightfall in autumn.");
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The program compiles and runs <em>exactly</em> the same as before.
The green color in the above program was added by hand.
However, most program editors (such as CodeGenie and BlueJ) are smart
enough to recognize  comments and will display them in color.
Of course, the text file contains only the characters you have entered.
