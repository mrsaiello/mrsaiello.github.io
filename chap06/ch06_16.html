<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
The person might be you.
Comments are often notes to yourself about what something is, or why you
did something the way you did.
</p>

<div class="lesson">
<h1>Braces</h1>
<A NAME="braces, matching"></A>
<p>
Another thing to notice in programs is that for every left brace ...
</p>

<blockquote>
<big>{</big> 
</blockquote>

<p>
there is a right brace
</p>

<blockquote>
<big>}</big> 
</blockquote>

<p>
... that matches.
Usually there will be sets of matching braces inside other
sets of matching braces.
The first brace in a class (which has to be a left brace)
will match the last brace in that class (which has to be a <em>right</em> brace).
A brace can match just one other brace.
Use indenting to help the human reader see how the
braces match (and thereby see how the program has been constructed),
as in the example:
</p>

<pre class="code">
class Haiku
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    System.out.println( "On a withered branch" );
    System.out.println( "A crow has just alighted:" );
    System.out.println( "Nightfall in autumn." );
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
There are many styles of laying out a program.
If you are reading a printed text book in addition to these notes,
it is likely that it uses a different style.
