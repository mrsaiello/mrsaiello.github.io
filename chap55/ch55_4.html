<h1>Event-driven Programming</h1>

<A NAME="event"></A>
<A NAME="event-driven programming"></A>

<p>
When you perform an action on a graphical component you 
generate an <b>event</b>.
In <b>event-driven programming</b> the program responds to these events.
The order of the events is determined by the user, not the program.
</p>

<p>
This is different from programs where user interaction
is done through the console.
In these programs, prompts are written to the console,
and the user responds to the prompts.
The order of the prompts is determined by the program.
</p>

<form>
<p>
For example, you can 
generate an event by clicking on this button: &nbsp;
<input type="button" value="Generate an Event" 
onClick="alert('The browser has just handled your event.')">&nbsp;
Or you could click on this button:&nbsp;
<input type="button" value="Generate another Event" 
onClick="alert('The browser has just handled another event.')">&nbsp;
Click on the buttons a few more times
in any order.
The program (your Web browser, in this case)
is event-driven and responds to 
the events in whatever order you generate.
</p>
</form>

<p>
If your browser is written in Java, then Swing components
generate the events and Java methods respond to them.
If your browser is written in C++, then other
components and methods, similar to Swing, are being used.
(Most browsers are written in C++).

<p>
How do you imagine that I wrote this Web page:

<ul>
<li>By writing thousands of lines of code from scratch, <b>or</b></li>
<li>By using HTML to include some button objects on the page.</li>
