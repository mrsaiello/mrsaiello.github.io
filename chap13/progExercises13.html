<h2>Exercise 1 --- Internet Delicatessen</h2>

<p>
<em>Sam and Ella's Delicatessen</em> wants you to write a program
to take orders from the Internet.
Your program asks for the item,
its price,
and if  overnight shipping is wanted.
Regular shipping for items under $10 is $2.00;
for items $10 or more shipping is $3.00.
For overnight delivery add $5.00.
</p>

<pre>
Enter the item:
Tuna Salad
Enter the price:
450
Overnight delivery (0==no, 1==yes)
1

Invoice:
  Tuna Salad    4.50
  shipping      7.00
  total         11.50
</pre>

<p>
(Use our ordinary IO methods. A real Internet order form would use 
different I/O methods, but ignore this.)

<h2>Exercise 2 --- Steam Engine Efficiency</h2>
<p>
The maximum possible efficiency of a steam engine depends on 
the temperature of the steam in the boiler
and the temperature of the outside air:
</p>

<pre>
efficiency = 1 - Tair / Tsteam
</pre>

<p>
where <code>Tair </code> is the air temperature
and  <code>Tsteam </code> is the steam temperature.
The temperatures are give in degrees above absolute zero.
Normal air temperature is about 300<sup>o</sup>K.
Boiling is 373<sup>o</sup>K.
Write a program that asks the user for the air temperature
and the steam temperature and writes out the 
maximum possible efficiency of a steam engine.
However,
if the steam temperature is less than 373<sup>o</sup>K
there is no steam, so the efficiency is zero.
</p>

<p>
Use integer or floating point input,
but do the calculations in floating point.

<h2>Exercise 3 --- Microwave Oven</h2>
<p>
A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when
heating two items, add 50% to the heating time,
and when heating three items double the heating time.
Heating more than three items at once is not recommended.
</p>

<p>
Write a program that asks the user for the number of items
and the single-item heating time.
The program then writes out the recommended heating time.
</p>

<p>
Hint: do this with four successive single-branch <em>if</em>
statements each of which tests for one of the four cases:
1 item, 2 items, 3 items, more than three items.
Look at the sports car purchase program in the chapter to see
how to do this, if you are stuck.

<h2>Exercise 4 --- Fantasy Game</h2>
<p>
In a new role-playing fantasy game players must design their
character by picking a point value for each of three characteristics:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Strength, from 1 to 10</li>
<li>Health, from 1 to 10</li>
<li>Luck, from 1 to 10</li>
</ul>

<p>
Write a program that asks for a name for the character and asks
for the point value of for each of the three characteristics.
However, <em>the total points must be less than 15</em>.
If the total exceeds 15, then 5 points are assigned to each characteristic
</P>

<pre>
Welcome to <em>Yertle's Quest</em>
Enter the name of your character:
Chortle
Enter strength (1-10):
8
Enter health (1-10):
4
Enter luck (1-10):
6

You have give your character too many points!  Default values have been assigned:
Chortle, strength: 5, health: 5, luck: 5
</pre>

(This user interface could get much more complicated.
You might want to implement some of your own ideas.)
