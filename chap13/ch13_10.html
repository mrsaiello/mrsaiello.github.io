<A NAME="if statement, repeated"></A>
<p>
Often there are several options that might be included in
a major purchase.
Each one might be accepted or rejected.
Pretend you are buying a new car:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You have decided to buy a new sports car.
The base price is $20,000.
There are two options:
</p>

<ul>
<li>pin strips &#8212; $250</li>
<li>anti-lock brakes &#8212; $800</li>
</ul>

<p>
The price of the car will be the base price plus
the price of the options you have picked.
Write a program that calculates the price of the car.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is an incomplete version.
The user is expected to enter "1" to mean <em>true</em> and "0"
to mean <em>false</em>.
There are better ways to do this which will be covered later in these notes.
</p>

<form>
<pre class="program">
import java.util.Scanner;
class CarPurchase
{
  public static void main (String[] args) 
  { 
    final int basePrice  = 2000000;   // base price in cents
    final int pinPrice   =   25000;   // pin stripe price
    final int brakePrice =   80000;   // anti-lock brake price

    Scanner scan = new Scanner( System.in );
 
    int answer;
    int totalCost = basePrice;

    System.out.print("Do you want pin stripes (0 or 1)? ");
     
    answer = scan.nextInt();        
    if ( <input type="text" name="textA" value="" size="30"> )
    {
      totalCost = totalCost + pinPrice;
    }

    System.out.print("Do you want anti-lock brakes (0 or 1)? ");
    answer = scan.nextInt(); 
    if ( <input type="text" name="textB" value="" size="30"> )
    {
      totalCost = totalCost + brakePrice;
    }

    System.out.println("Total cost is: $" + 
        (totalCost/100) + "." + totalCost%100 );
 
  }
}
</pre>
</form>

<p>
Notice how the number in <code>totalCost</code> is accumulated: it is initialized
in its declaration, then added to in each of the <em>true</em> branches.

Fill in the two blanks to complete the program.
You may wish to copy the program to an editor
and try it out.
