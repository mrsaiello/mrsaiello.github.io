<h3>Answer:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is the tube of tennis balls an object?
    <ul><li><span class="blue">Yes. It has
    identity (my tube of balls is different than yours), it has state (opened,
    unopened, brand name, location), and behavior (although not much).</span></li></ul></li>
<li>Is each tennis ball an object? 
    <ul><li><span class="blue">Yes.  It is OK for
    objects to be part of other objects.  Although each ball has nearly the
    same state and behavior as the others, each has its own identity.</span></li></ul></li>
<li>Could the top two balls be considered a single object? 
    <ul><li><span class="blue">
    Not ordinarily.  Each has its own identity independent of the other.
    If they were joined together with a stick you might consider them as one
    object.</span></li></ul></li>
<li>Is the color of the balls an object? 
    <ul><li><span class="blue">No.  It is a property
    of each ball.</span></li></ul></li>
<li>Is your understanding of tennis balls an object? 
    <ul><li><span class="blue">Probably not,
    although it is unclear what it is.  Perhaps it is a property of the
    object called "your brain."</span></li></ul></li>

<h1>Software Objects</h1>
<p>
Many programs are written to do things that are concerned with the real world.
It is convenient to have "software objects" that are similar to
"real world objects".
This makes the program and its computation easier to think about.
Software objects will have 
<em>identity</em>, <em> state</em>, and <em>behavior</em> just as
do real world objects.
Of course,
 software objects exist entirely within a computer system
and don't directly affect real world objects.
