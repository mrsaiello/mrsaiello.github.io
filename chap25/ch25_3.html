<p>
What makes an object?
</p>
</div>
<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
Here is my  unofficial list:
</p>

<ul>
<li>An object is made of tangible material (the pen is made of plastic, metal, ink).</li>
<li>An object holds together as a single whole (the whole pen, not a fog).</li>
<li>An object has properties (the color of the pen, where it is, how thick it writes...).</li>
<li>An object can do things and can have things done to it.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Characteristics of Objects</h1>
<p>
The first item in this list is too restrictive.
For example, you can think of your bank account as an object,
but it is not made of material
(although you and the bank may use material in keeping track of your
account, your account exists independently of this material.)
Although it is not material your account has properties (the balance,
interest rate, owner) and you can do things to it (deposit money, cancel it)
and it can do things (charge for transcactions, appreciate interest).
</p>

<A NAME="object, characteristics"></A>
<p>
The last three items on the list seem clear enough.
In fact, they have names:
</p>

<ul>
<li>An object has <b>identity</b> (it acts as a single whole).</li>
<li>An object has <b>state</b> (it has various properties, which might change).</li>
<li>An object has <b>behavior</b> (it can do things and can have things done to it).</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a somewhat ordinary description of what an object is like.
(This list 
comes from the book <em>Object-oriented Analysis and Design</em>, by Grady Booch,
Addison-Wesley, 1994.)
Do not be surprised if other notes and books have a different list.
When you start writing object-oriented software 
you will find that 
this list will help you decide what your objects should be.
