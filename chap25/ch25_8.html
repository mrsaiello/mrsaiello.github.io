<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
No.  Just because there is a name for an object does not mean an object
exists.

A class is like a cookie cutter that can be used  many times 
to make many cookies.
There is only one cookie cutter, but can be used to make many
cookies.
Cookies are objects and each
one has its own individuality 
because each one is made out of a
different section of dough.
Different cookies may have different characteristics,
even though they follow the same basic pattern.
For example, cookies may have candy
sprinkles or frosting, or may be baked for different lengths of time.
</p>

<A NAME="Cookie Monster"></A>
<p>
Cookies can be created.
And cookies can be destroyed (just ask Cookie Monster).
But destroying cookies does not affect the
cookie cutter.
It can be used again if there is dough left.
</p>

<p>
A big cookie jar might require many cookies made with many different
cookie patterns (stars, hearts, squares).
A big cookie 
(such as a gingerbread house) 
might be built out of
many smaller cookies of several different types.

<h3> QUESTION 8:</h3>
<p>
(Thought question:) Cookies in the real world are objects, of course.
But real world cookie cutters are objects too.
Do you think that a Java class has an object-like nature,
just as does a cookie cutter?
