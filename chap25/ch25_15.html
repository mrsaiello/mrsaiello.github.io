<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
No.  A constructor is used once per object.
Once an object has been created the constructor is finished.

<h1>Dot Notation</h1>
<A NAME="immutable object"></A>

<p>
After an object has been constructed it can (usually) be changed by
using its own methods (<u>not</u> its constructor).
However, some objects are designed so that their data
cannot be changed after the object has been constructed.
The class <code>String</code> is one of these.
String objects are <b>immutable</b>.
This means that after construction, 
they cannot be altered.
</p>

<A NAME="dot notation"></A>
<p>
The variables and methods of an object are  
called the <b>members</b> of that object.
The members of an object are accessed using <b>dot notation</b>.
The example program creates a <code>String</code> object,
referred to by the variable
<code>str1</code>.
</p>

<pre>
String str1;   // str1 is a reference to an object.
int    len;    
str1 = new String("Random Jottings");  // create an object of type String
                                                       
len  = <span class="red">str1.length()</span>;  // invoke the object's method length()
</pre>

<p>
The <code>length()</code> method is a member of the object.
To run a method of the object referenced by <code>str1</code> do this:
</p>

<pre>
len  = <span class="red">str1.length()</span>;  
</pre>

<p>
This assignment statement, as always, does its work in two steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The expression on the right of the <code>=</code> is evaluated.</li>
<li>The resulting value is stored in the variable on the left of the <code>=</code> sign.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The right side of this particular assignment statement executes the
method <code>length()</code> which is member of the object referenced by <code>str1</code>.
Executing this method 
returns the number of characters in the object.
