<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
Yes.  A class definition will have <em>its own</em> variables (state),
and will have <em>its own</em> methods (behavior.)
</p>

<h1>Static Methods</h1>
<A NAME="static method"></A>
<A NAME="class method"></A>
<p>
The methods that a class definition has are called <b>static methods</b>.
(Sometimes they are called <em>class methods</em>, but this is confusing.)
A static method is a characteristic of a class, not of the objects it has
created.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>Important:</b>
<em>A program can execute a static method without first creating an object!</em>
All other methods (those that are not static) must be part of an object. 
An object must exist before they can be executed.
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is the example program again:
</p>

<pre class="program">
// The file StringTester.java
//
class StringTester
{

  public <span class="red">static</span> void main ( String[] args )
  {
    String str1;   // str1 is a reference to an object, 
    int    len;    // len is a primitive variable of type int

    str1 = new String("Random Jottings");  // create an object of type String
                                                           
    len  = str1.length();  // invoke the object's method length()

    System.out.println("The string is " + len + " characters long");
  }
}
</pre>
 
<A NAME="virtual machine, startup"></A>
<p>
This application is similar to many you have  seen so far.
Now you can understand more details about what is going on.
Assume that a file named <code>StringTester.java</code> contains 
the above source code.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The file defines a class called <code>StringTester</code>.</li>
<li>The class has a static method called <code>main()</code>.</li>
<li>Since <code>main()</code> is a static method, 
    it is a characteristic of the class.
    Objects of the class do not have a <code>main()</code> method.
    <ul><li>
    Since <code>main()</code> is a static method, 
    there will be only one <code>main()</code> method.
    </li></ul>
    </li>
<li>After the file has been compiled, the resulting bytecodes are executed
    by the Java virtual machine.
    <ul><li>
    The user executes the program by typing <code>java StringTester</code>.
    </li></ul>
    </li>
<li>The Java virtual machine looks into the bytecode version of the
    class definition for the <code>main()</code> method.
    <ul><li>
    No object exists at this point.
    </li></ul>
    </li>
<li>The <code>main()</code> method starts running, 
    creates a <code>String</code> object using <code>new</code>, 
    invokes its <code>length()</code> method, and continues.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Remember the idea of object-oriented programming: an application consists
of a collection of cooperating software objects whose methods are
executed in a particular order to get something useful done.
The steps listed above is how the collection of objects gets started.
(In this case only one object was created.)

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 13:</h3>
<p>
Say that you create a file that 
contains the definition of a class,
but the  the class contains no <code>main()</code> method.
Can the methods of this class ever be executed?
