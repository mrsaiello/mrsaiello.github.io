<h1>What Makes an Object?</h1>
<p>
It is easier to list things that are objects than to list things that
are not objects.
Just to talk about something seems to make it an object, somehow.
Ren&eacute; Descartes (the 17th century philosopher) observed that humans
view the world in object oriented terms.
The human brain wants to think about objects,
and our thoughts and memories are organized into objects and their relationships.
Perhaps non-human brains work differently.
</p>

<p>
One of the ideas of object-oriented software is to organized software
in a way that matches the thinking style of our object-oriented brains.
Instead of machine instructions that change bit patterns in main storage,
we want "things" that "do something."
Of course,
at the machine level nothing has changed&#8212;bit patterns are being manipulated
by machine instructions.
But we don't have to think that way.
