<p>
Classes are mostly used to create objects,
just as a cookie cutter is mostly used to create cookies.
But a class has an existence,
just as a cookie cutter has an existence.
A class and its objects are different types of things,
just as a cookie cutter and its cookies are different types of things.
</p>

<p>
A cookie cutter has characteristics that are not shared with cookies.
For example, a cookie cutter is made of steel and has sharp edges.
After a cookie cutter has been used for a while,
there will be many cookies (soft, rounded, doughy things) but
only one thing made of steel with sharp edges.
</p>

<p>
In the Java language, a characteristic of a class definition 
that is not shared by its objects
is called <b>static</b>.
There is only   one class definition for a given class,
so when a program is running,  
if something is <code>static</code> then there is only one of it.
</p>

<p>
You can think of the word <code>static</code> as meaning "no matter how many
objects are made, there will be only one of these."

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 12:</h3>
<p>
Recall the three properties of objects:
<em>identity</em>,<em> state</em>, and <em>behavior</em>.
Do you expect that a class definition will have its own state and behavior?
