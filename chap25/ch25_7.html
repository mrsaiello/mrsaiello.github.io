<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
Every application so far in these notes starts with
</p>

<pre>
public static void main ( String[] args ) 
</pre>

<p>
This identifies the main method in the class.

<h1>Class</h1>
<A NAME="class, definition"></A>
<p>
When a Java application is run,
objects are created and their methods are invoked (are run).
To create an object,
there needs to be a description of it.
</p>

<blockquote>
A <b>class</b> is a description of a kind of object.
A programmer may define a class using Java, or may use
predefined classes that come in class libraries.
</blockquote>

<p>
A class is merely a plan for a possible object.
It does not by itself create any objects.
When a programmer wants to create an object 
the <code>new</code>
operator is used with the name of the class.
Creating an object is called <b>instantiation</b>.
</p>

<p>
Here is a tiny application that <em>instatiates</em> an object
by following the plan in the class <code>String</code>:
</p>

<pre class="program">
class StringTester
{

  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    String str1;   // str1 is a variable that may refer to an object. 
                   // The object does not exist unit the "new" is executed.
    int    len;    // len is a primitive variable of type int

    str1 = new String("Random Jottings");  // create an object of type String
                                                           
    len  = str1.length();  // invoke the object's method length()

    System.out.println("The string is " + len + " characters long");
  }
}
</pre>



<p>
When it is executed,
the line
</p>

<pre class="code">
str1 = new String("Random Jottings");
</pre>


<A NAME="length(), String"></A>
<p>
creates an object by following the description in class <code>String</code>.
The class <code>String</code> is defined in the class library <code>java.lang</code>
that comes with the Java system.
The computer system finds a chunk of memory for the object,
lays out this memory according to the plan (the definition of <code>String</code>),
and puts data and methods into it.
</p>

<p>
The data in this String object will be the characters "Random Jottings"
and the methods will be the many methods that all <code>String</code> objects have.
One of these methods is <code>length()</code>.
</p>

<p>
The variable <code>str1</code> is used to refer to this object.
In other words, <code>str1</code> gives the object a name.
</p>

<h3> QUESTION 7:</h3>
<p>
If a program has a name for an object, does that mean that an object really exists?
