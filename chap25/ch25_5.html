<h1>Software Objects as Memory</h1>
<A NAME="objects, as memory"></A>
<p>
It is only a slight exaggeration to say that memory 
(both main memory and secondary memory)
is all that there is
inside of a computer 
The other pieces of electronics&#8212;the processor chip, the busses, the
power supply, the keyboard, the video card and so on&#8212;exist only to
work on memory and to show what it contains.
So what else could a software object be but a chunk of memory?
</p>

<p>
(Actually, it is not quite correct to claim that a software object is a
"chunk" of memory.  A software object is somewhat like a bank account&#8212;its
existence is spread out and does not correspond one-to-one with any particular
piece of material.  But for now it is convenient and reasonably accurate to
think of a software object as a chunk of memory.)
</p>

<p>
Objects (real world and software) 
have <em>identity</em>, <em> state</em>, and <em>behavior</em>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Software objects have <b>identity</b>. Each is a distinct chunk of
memory. (Just like a yellow tennis ball, each software object is a distinct
individual even though it may look nearly the same as other objects.) 
</p>

<p>
Software objects have <b>state.</b>
Some of the memory that makes up a software object is used for variables
which contain values. These values are the state of the object.
</p>

<p>
Software objects have <b>behavior.</b>
Some of the memory that makes up a software object contains
programs (called <em>methods</em>) that enable the object to "do things".
The object does something when one of its method runs.
