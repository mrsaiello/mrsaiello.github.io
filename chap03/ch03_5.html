<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
Usually we don't want it to 
(and for audio data use "high fidelity" electronics to minimize the change.)
But always some information is lost.

<p>
One bit of information is so little that usually computer memory is
organized into groups of eight bits.
Each eight bit group is called a <b>byte</b>.
When more than eight bits are required for some data,
a whole number of bytes are used.
One byte is about enough memory to hold a single character.
</p>

<p>
Often very much more than eight bits are required for data, 
and thousands, millions, or even billions of bytes are needed.
These amounts have names, as seen in the table.
</p>

<p>
If you expect computers to be your career, it would be a good idea to become
very familiar with this table.
(Except that the only   number you should remember from the middle column
is that a kilobyte is 1024 bytes.)
Often a kilobyte is called a "K" and a megabyte is called a "Meg."

<p>
Some Hollywood actors have been named after units of memory,
for example, Giga Young.
Can you think of any others?
