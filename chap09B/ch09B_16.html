<h1>Constants</h1>
<p>
Often in a program you want to  give a name to a  constant value.
For example you might have a tax rate of 0.045 for durable goods and
a tax rate of 0.038 for non-durable goods.
These are constants, because their value is not going to change 
when the program is executed.
It is convenient to give these constants a name.
This can be done:
</p>

<pre class="code">
class CalculateTax
{
  public static void main ( String[] arg )
  {
    <font color=blue>final</font> double DURABLE = 0.045;
    <font color=blue>final</font> double NONDURABLE = 0.038;

    . . . . . .
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The reserved word <b>final</b> tells the compiler that the
value will not change.
The names of constants follow the same rules as the 
names for variables.
(Programmers sometimes use all capital letters for constants;
but that is a matter of personal style, not part of the language.)
Now the constants can be used in expressions like:
</p>

<pre class="code">
taxamount = gross * DURABLE ;
</pre>

<p>
But the following is a syntax error:
</p>

<pre class="code">
DURABLE = 0.441;    // try (and fail) to change the tax rate.
</pre>

<p>
In your programs,
use a named constant like DURABLE rather than using a literal like 0.441.
There are two advantages in doing this:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Constants make your program easier to read and check for correctness.</li>
<li>If a constant needs to be changed (for instance if the tax rates change)
    all you need to do is change the declaration of the constant.
    You don't have to search through your program for every occurence of a specific
    number.</li>
</ol>

<h3> QUESTION 16:</h3>
<p>
Could ordinary variables be used for these two advantages?
What is another advantage of using <code>final</code>?
