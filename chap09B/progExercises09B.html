Chapter 9B  Programming Exercises </h1></center>

<p>
<b>General Instructions:</b>
Write each of these programs as specified.
None of these programs expect the user to enter data.
The values one of these programs uses is "hard wired" into the program
with declaration statements or assignment statements.
Usually this is a poor way to write a program.
Input will be covered in the next two chapters.
After you read them you could come back and write
a better version of these programs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
Each of these exercises asks you to run the program several times
with different values.
This is important to do!
Playing with your programs is vital to understanding them and getting
"feel" of programming under you skin.

<h2>Exercise 1 --- Average Rain Fall</h2>
<p>
Write a program that averages the rain fall for three months, April, May, and June.
Declare and initialize a variable to the rain fall for each month.
Compute the average, and write out the results, something like:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Rainfall for April:  12
Rainfall for May  :  14
Rainfall for June:   8
Average rainfall:    11.333333
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
To get the numerical values to line up use the tabulation character <code>'\t'</code>
 as part
of the character string in the output statements.
Check that your program prints the correct results.
There is a beginner's error lurking in this program too!
Did you fall victim to it?

<h2>Exercise 2 --- Trigonometry</h2>
<p>
To compute the <em>sine</em> of a double precision value
use this method:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Math.sin( value )
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <em>value</em> is in radians (not degrees.)
The <em>cosine</em> is computed using
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Math.cos( value )
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, <em>value</em> is in radians.
Write a program that:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Computes the sine of  0.5236 radians and saves it in a variable.</li>
<li>Computes the cosine of  0.5236 radians and saves it in another variable.</li>
<li>Computes the square of each those two values (use the variables),
    adds the two squares, and saves the result (in a third variable.)</li>
<li>Writes out the three variables.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The output statement should be something like:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
System.out.println("sine: " + sinx + " cosine: " + cosx + " sum: " + sum );
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Try a few other values besides 0.5236.

<h2>Exercise 3 --- Degrees to Radians</h2>
<p>
It is sometimes hard to think in terms of radians;
we would rather use degrees.
Remember (from those dark days of trigonometry class) that there
are PI radians per 180 degrees.
So to convert an angle given in degrees to radians do this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
rad = degrees * Math.PI/180
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
Math.PI gives you an accurate value of PI.
</p>

<p>
Edit the previous program so that it does the same things,
but the angle is 30 degrees (which you will convert into radians.)
