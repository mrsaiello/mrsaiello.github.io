<p>
Do you expect that a modern electronic calculator will give you the same
answer as Java for the expression 
<nobr>&nbsp;<code>(31.5 - 12)/4.1</code>&nbsp;</nobr>?
</p>

</div>
<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
Yes.  The meaning of operators and parentheses is <em>about</em>
the same in electronic calculators and in Java.
But Java does integer <b>and</b> floating point math, and sometimes
this can make a difference.

<h1>Weird Integer Arithmetic</h1>
<A NAME="integer division"></A>

<p>
The division operator <code><b>/</b></code> means <b>integer division</b> if there
is an integer on <em>both</em> sides of it.
If one or two sides has a floating point number, then it means 
<b>floating point division</b>.
The result of integer division is always an integer;
if the exact result calls for a decimal fraction, that part of the result is
dropped (not rounded).
</p>

<p>
There is a difference between what Java 
will do and what a  calculator will do.
A  calculator will  do floating point arithmetic for the
expression:

<pre class="code">
7/2
</pre>

<p>
Java will regard this as integer arithmetic and give you:
</p>

<pre class="code">
7/2 = 3
</pre>

<p>
This is easy enough to see when it is by itself,
but here is a more confusing case of the same thing:

<pre class="code">
1.5 + 7/2
</pre>
<p>
The division will be done first, 
because <code><b>/</b></code> has higher precedence than <code><b>+</b></code>.
The result, 3, is an integer.
Now floating point 1.5 is added to integer 3 to get floating point 4.5.
</p>

<p>
Integer arithmetic may be used in 
parts of an expression and not in others,
even though the final value of the expression is floating point.
Most programming languages do this.
Believe it or not,
it is fortunate that Java works this way.
It would be <em>awful</em> if what was done in the middle of
a calculation depended on the final result.
