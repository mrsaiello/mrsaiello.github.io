<h1>Advantages of Binary 2: Unambiguous Signals</h1>
<A NAME="wood carving"></A>
<p>
Carving a block of wood
into a book page requires 
high technical and artistic skill.
The task is complex and labor intensive.
A small mistake might ruin the whole block.
The Renaissance woodcarvers 
were as skilled as woodcarvers ever have been.
</p>

<A NAME="type setting"></A>
<p>
Setting type is comparatively easy.
Little artistic or technical skill is needed.
Individual pieces of type are just dropped into place.
The method is robust and reliable; mistakes can be corrected.
The type can be reused many times.
</p>

<A NAME="Gutenberg"></A>
<p>
It is a paradox that advances in
technology often lead to simple methods.
Woodcarving is complex; setting type is easy.
The computer revolution (ca. 1950&#8212;) is
often compared to the Gutenberg revolution
(ca. 1450&#8212;).

Review the advantages of binary:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li> Simple; easy to build.</li>
<li> Unambiguous signals (hence noise immunity).</li>
<li> Flawless copies can be made.</li>
<li> Anything that can be represented with
     patterns can be represented 
     with patterns of bits.</li>
</ol>
