<b>Unambigous Signals:</b>
Consider Paul Revere, waiting for 
news of the attack of the British troops.
He is expecting to see  a signal lantern
in the tower of
Old North Church telling him how the British 
are attacking:
</p>

<blockquote>
1.32456 if by land, 1.71922 if by sea.
</blockquote>

<p>
The signal shines out!
...and Paul Revere's famous ride is delayed
for several hours as he tries to figure out
just how bright that signal is.
</p>

<p>
Lack of ambiguity is a tremendous advantage.
The signal that Paul Revere was actually waiting 
for that night in 1775 was:
</p>

<blockquote>
One (lantern) if by land, and two (lanterns) if by sea.
</blockquote>

<A NAME="discrete"></A>
<p>
...an easily interpreted signal.
All Paul Revere had to do was count.
Such signals are called <b>discrete</b>
because they have a fixed number of definite states.
Sometimes the word <b>digital</b> is used to mean the same thing.
