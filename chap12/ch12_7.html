<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<pre>
Enter an integer:
17
The number 17 is positive
positive numbers are greater than zero
Good-bye for now
</pre>

<p>
The <em>false block</em> was executed because the answer to the
question <code>(num &lt; 0)</code> was <em>false</em>.
The false block consists of two statements.

<h1>Outline of a Two-way Decision</h1>
<A NAME="two-way decision, details"></A>
<p>
Here is how an outline of how make a two-way decision:
</p>

<pre class="code">
// statements that are executed before the decision

<font color=red>if</font> ( condition )
    // true branch

<font color=red>else</font>
    // false branch

// statements that are executed after the branches join together again
</pre>

<p>
Here are some details:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>condition</em> evaluates to <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>,
    often by comparing variables and values.</li>
<li>The <em>else</em> divides the true branch from the false branch.</li>
<li>The statements after the false branch are always executed.</li>
<li>A block consists of several statements inside a pair of braces, { and }.</li>
<li>The true branch can be a block.</li>
<li>The false branch can be a block.</li>
<li>There can be as many statements in a block as you need.</li>
<li>When a block is chosen for execution, the statements in it are executed one by one.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The  <em>condition</em>	can compare what is held in a variable to other values.
You can use the comparisons <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and so on.
(More about these later.)
The first statement after the false branch will be executed no matter which
branch is chosen.
The <code>if-else</code> is like a fork in the road,
but the road always comes together again.

Is the following section of a program correct?

if ( num &lt; 0 )
