<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>

<pre>
Enter an integer:
0
The number 0 is positive
Good-bye for now
</pre>

<p>
This is not actually true. Zero is neither negative nor positive,
although often programs treat zero as if it were positive.
We will fix this problem in a few pages.

<h1>More than one Statement per Branch</h1>

Here is the program again with some added statements:
</p>

<pre class="program">
import java.util.Scanner;

class NumberTester
{
  public static void main (String[] args)
  {
    Scanner scan = new Scanner( System.in );
    int num;

    System.out.println("Enter an integer:");
    num = scan.nextInt();

    if ( num &lt; 0 )
    {
      System.out.println("The number " + num + " is negative");   // true-branch
      System.out.println("negative numbers are less than zero");  // true-branch
    } 
    else
    {
      System.out.println("The number " + num + " is positive");   // false-branch
      System.out.print  ("positive numbers are greater ");        // false-branch
      System.out.println("than zero ");                           // false-branch
    }

    System.out.println("Good-bye for now");    // always executed

<A NAME="block statement"></A>
<p>
To include more than one statement in a branch,
enclose the statements with braces, 
<big>{</big> and <big>}</big>.
A group of statements grouped together like this is called a
<b>block statement</b>, (or usually, just <em>block</em>).
There can be as many statements as you want in a block.
A block can go anyplace a single statement can go.
All the statements in the <em>true block</em> are executed when
the answer to the question is <em>true</em>.
</p>
<p>
Of course,
all the statements in the <em>false block</em> are executed when
the answer to the question is <em>false</em>.
The  <em>false block</em> consists of the block that follows the <code>else</code>.
Notice that the very last statement in the program is not part of the false block.
