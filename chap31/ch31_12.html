<p>
When a program starts running there are no objects, 
just class definitions and
a static <nobr><code>main()</code></nobr> method.
Usually <code>main()</code> then constructs 
some objects and calls their
methods to do the work of the program.
In our example,
<code>main()</code> constructs just one object and then calls its 
<code>calculateMPG()</code> method.
</p>

<p>
The picture shows the variable <code>car</code> in the static 
<nobr><code>main()</code></nobr> method
referring to the object that has been constructed
following the class definition of <code>Car</code>.
The  static <code>main()</code> method is part of the
<code>MilesPerGallon</code> class.
</p>

<p>
In the picture, the class definitions are shown as pink clouds
as a reminder that they are not full objects.
The object in this picture is shown as a solid rectangle.
