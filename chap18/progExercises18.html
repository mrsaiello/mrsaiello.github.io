<h2>Exercise 1 --- Miles per Gallon</h2>

<p>
Write a program that calculates miles per gallon for
a list of cars.
The data for each car consists of initial odometer reading,
final odometer reading, and number of gallons of gas.
The user signals that there are no more cars by entering
a negative initial odometer reading.
</p>

<pre>
Miles Per Gallon Program
Initial miles:
15000
Final miles:
15250
Gallons
10
Miles per Gallon: 25.0

Initial miles:
107000
Final miles:
107450
Gallons
15
Miles per Gallon: 30.0

Initial miles:
-1

<h2>Exercise 2 --- In-range Adder</h2>
<p>
Write a program that asks the user for the low
and high integer in a range of integers.
The program then asks the user for integers
to be added up.
The program computes two sums:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The sum of integers that are in the range (inclusive),</li>
<li>and the sum of integers that are outside of the range.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The user signals the end of input with a 0.
</p>

<pre>
In-range Adder
Low end of range:
20
High end of range:
50
Enter data:
21
Enter data:
60
Enter data:
49
Enter data:
30
Enter data:
91
Enter data:
0
Sum of in range values: 100
Sum of out of range values: 151

<h2>Exercise 3 --- Shipping Cost Calculator</h2>
<p>
A mail order company charges $3.00 for handling,
free shipping for orders 10 pounds or less,
plus $0.25 for each pound over 10.
Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for the
weight of an order, then writes out the shipping charge.
The program stops when a weight of zero or less is
entered.
</p>

<pre>
Weight of Order:
5
Shipping Cost: $3.00

Weight of Order
20
Shipping Cost: $5.50

Weight of Order
0

<h2>Exercise 4 --- Area of Rectangles</h2>
<img src="progEx3.gif" align="right" hspace="20" />

<p>
A computer aided design program expects users to enter 
the coordinates two corners for each of several of rectangles (see diagram.)
The sides of the rectangles are assumed to be parallel to the X and Y axes.
The coordinates of each corner is entered as a pair of integers, first the
X coordinate and then the Y coordinate.
The origin of the coordinate system (0,0) is in the upper left, so Y increases
going downward, and X increases to the right.
</p>

<p>
For each rectangle,
the program calculates and writes out the height, the width, and the area of
the rectangle.
The two corners entered for each rectangle must be diagonally opposite (upper left and
lower right, or upper right and lower left), but which choice is made for each
rectangle is up to the user.
The user can enter the corners in any order.
Height and width are always positive (the program will have to adjust its calculations
so that this is true.)
</p>

<p>
The program ends gracefully when the user enters corners which cannot be those
of a rectangle (either the height is zero, the width is zero, or both.)
</p>
