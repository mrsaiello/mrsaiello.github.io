<div class="questionEcho">
<p>
What would happen if the very first integer the user entered were 0 ?
</p>

</div>
<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
The loop body would not execute even once.
The program would print out:
</p>

<pre>
Sum of the integers: 0
</pre>

<h1>Example Program Run</h1>
<p>
The user must have a way to say that there are no integers to add.
This might seem dumb in a small program like this, but in larger
programs with many options and more complicated processing it is often
important to be able to skip over a loop.
Sometimes beginning programmers assume that
there will always be some numbers to add.
Big mistake.
</p>

<p>
Often a loop processes  data that is the result of a previous part of the program.  
That previous part of the program might not have produced any data.  
For example, a monthly checking account report
must deal with those months where the customer has written no checks.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example run of this program,
with color added to match the Java statements:
</p>

<pre class="program">
C:\users\temp&gt;java AddUpNumbers

<span class="blue">Enter first integer (enter 0 to quit):</span> 12
<span class="green">Enter next integer (enter 0 to quit):</span> -3
<span class="green">Enter next integer (enter 0 to quit):</span> 4
<span class="green">Enter next integer (enter 0 to quit):</span> 0
<span class="red">Sum of the integers: 13</span>

</pre>

<p>
Here is the relevant section of the program:
</p>

<pre class="program">
    // get the first value
    System.out.println( "<span class="blue">Enter first integer (enter 0 to quit):</span>" );
    value = scan.nextInt();

    while ( value != 0 )    
    {
      //add value to sum
      sum = sum + value;

      //get the next value from the user
      System.out.println( "<span class="green">Enter next integer (enter 0 to quit):</span>" );
      value = scan.nextInt();
    }

    System.out.println( "<span class="red">Sum of the integers: " + sum </span>);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The value 0 in this program is the sentinel value.
When the loop starts up,
it is not known how many times the loop will execute.
Even the user might not know;
there might be a long list of numbers to be added and the
user might not know in advance how many there are.

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 5:</h3>
<p>
The value 0 in this program is the sentinel value.
Could any other value be used?
