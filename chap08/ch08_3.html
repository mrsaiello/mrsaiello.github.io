<h3>Answer:</h3>

<p>
Without knowing more about how the pattern is being used,
it is impossible to say.
</p>

<h1>There are Many Data Types</h1>
<p>
You might be tempted say that the pattern 0000000000000000 represents
"zero".  But it doesn't necessarily.  
Even such an obvious pattern has no 
automatic meaning.
</p>

<p>
If you were told that the above pattern were of type <code>short</code>, then you
would know that it represents the integer zero.
Here is another pattern:
</p>

<pre class="code">
1111111110011001
</pre>
 
<p>
As a <code>short</code>, this pattern represents -103 (negative one hundred three). 
</p>

<p>
There are uncountably many types of data that can be represented in the
memory of a computer.
If specific patterns always had specific meanings, then only a few types of data
could be represented.
This would be much too restrictive.
Many data types are <em>invented</em> by programmers as they write programs.
Without this flexibility computers would be much less useful.
</p>

<p>
Not all machines use memory this way.
A simple electronic calculator, for example, uses memory for one
purpose only: to store floating point numbers.
It uses only one data type, and can do only those few things 
with that data type that
it has been wired to do.
The engineers who designed the calculator decided how
to represent numbers with bit strings, and then designed the
electronics to work with just those strings.
This is too restrictive for a general purpose computer.

Do you imagine that the computers of the 1960's were built to handle
audio data?
