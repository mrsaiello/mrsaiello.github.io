<p>
Do you suspect that <em>characters</em> are important enough to
be one of the eight primitive data types?

<h1>The <code> char </code> Primitive Data Type</h1>
<A NAME="char"></A>
<A NAME="characters"></A>
<p>
Characters are very common in computers.
The primitive data type 
for characters is named <code>char</code>.
The <code>char</code> type represents a character using 16 bits.
In many programming languages, only 8 bits are used for this purpose.
Java uses 16 bits so that a very large number of characters 
can be represented, nearly all of the characters in all of
the World's languages.
The method used is called Unicode.
</p>

<p>
For example, here is a 16 bit pattern:
</p>

<pre class="code">
000000000110011
</pre>

<p>
If you know that these 16 bits are of data type <code>char</code>, then you
could look in a table and discover that they represent the character 'g'.
If you have a really good memory, you might recall that the same 16 bits
represent the integer 103 if they are regarded as data type <code>short</code>.
Knowing the data type of a pattern is necessary to make sense of it.
</p>

<p>
Upper and lower case characters are represented by different patterns.
Punctuation and special characters are also <code>char</code> data.
There are also special characters, like the space character that
separates words.
</p>

<A NAME="control character"></A>
<p>
<b>Control characters</b> 
are bit patterns that show the end of a line
or where to start pages.
Other control characters represent the mechanical activities of old
communications equipment (such as teletypes) that are rarely used these days.
Many of these control characters are no longer used for their
original purpose.
</p>

<p>
Primitive type <code>char</code> represents <em>a SINGLE</em> character.
It does not include any font information.
When you want to deal with more than one character at a time (almost always),
you need to use objects that have been built out of <code>char</code> data.

<h3> QUESTION 13:</h3>
<p>
Is each of the following a different character?

<pre class="code">

(Depending on the fonts your browser is using, you
may have to look carefully.)
