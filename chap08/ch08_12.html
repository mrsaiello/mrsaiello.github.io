<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
There are <em>nine</em> decimal places of precision.
Data type <code>float</code> can't handle that.
(The compiler will round the number into a value that can fit 
in a <code>float</code>).

<h1>Precision of Double</h1>
<p>
You might wish to argue that there are only five places used in the above
number: the places used by the digits 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9.
However, the four 0's in the middle do count.
It takes bits to represent them, even if they are zeros.
</p>

<p>
Primitive data type <code>double</code> uses 64 bits, and has a much greater
range, -1.7E+308 to +1.7E+308.
It also has a much greater precision: about 15 significant decimal digits.
</p>

<A NAME="literal, double precision"></A>
<p>
Because of this, if you write a literal like 2.345 in a Java program,
it will automatically be regarded as a double, even
though a float might be good enough.
The other numbers in the program might need to be double, so we might
as well make them all double.

<h3> QUESTION 12:</h3>
<p>
Do you suspect that <em>characters</em> are  important enough to
be one of the eight primitive data types?
