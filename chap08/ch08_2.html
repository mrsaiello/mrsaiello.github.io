<h1>Data Types</h1>
<p>
You would like to see the rest of the paper,
or know where it came from.
Without knowing the context, 
it is hard to say what MIX means.
It <em>could</em> be 1009 in Roman numerals, or it could be the
English word "mix" (which itself has several meanings), or 
it could be the last name of the old-time radio hero Tom Mix.
It could be part of a label on a music CD, "MTV Dance MIX",
or part of a label on a bottle, "BLOODY MARY MIX".
Or maybe you are looking at it upside down and it should be "XIW".
Of course, it might
not be English at all.
Without knowing the context, a string of letters
has little meaning.
</p>

<p>
Computer memory stores arbitrary bit patterns.
As with a string of letters,
the meaning of a string of bits depends on how
it is used.
The particular scheme that is being used for a particular
string of bits is a <b>data type.</b>
</p>

<A NAME="data type"></A>
<p>
A <b>data type</b>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Is a scheme for using bits to represent values.</li>
<li>Values are not just numbers, but any kind of data that a computer can process.</li>
<li>All values in a computer are represented using one data type or another.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example
</p>

<pre class="code">
0000000001100111
</pre>
 
<p>
is a pattern of 16 bits that might be found somewhere in computer memory.
What does it represent?
</p>
<p>
Without knowing more about how the above pattern is being used, it is
impossible to say what it represents.
The type <code>short</code> is one of Java's data types.
If the pattern is of data type <code>short</code>, then it represents the value
103 (one hundred and three).
