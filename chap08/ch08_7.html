<p>
Can data type  <code>short</code>  hold  the value 1,023,004 ?
</p>

</div>
<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
No.  Data of type  <code>short</code>  can be only in the range -32,768 to +32,767.

<h1>More Bits for More Range</h1>
<p>
Larger ranges of numeric values require more bits.
The different sizes for integer data enable 
you to pick an
appropriate size for the data you are working with.
Usually you should pick a data type that has a range <b>much greater</b>
than the range of numbers you expect to deal with.
If  a program uses only a few dozen variables
it will run just as fast and take up about as much main memory
no matter what size is used for its variables.
</p>

<p>
Why do the small sized data types exist, then?
Well, many real-world programs deal with massive amounts of data
(billions of data items) and then 
using the smaller sizes may save significant amounts of space and time.
But we will not use that much data in these notes.
Usually you should use <code>int</code> or <code>double</code>
for your numeric data.
</p>

<A NAME="literal, integer"></A>
<p>
When you write a program you do not have to know how to represent a number
in bits.
You can type the number just as you would on a typewriter.
This is called a <b>literal</b>.
The word "literal" means that a value is 
explicitly part of the program.
For example, 125 literally repesents the value one hundred twenty five.
Integer <em>literals</em> in a program are written as in a book,
except there are no commas:
</p>

<pre class="code">
125          -32            16            0         -123987
</pre>
 
<p>
All of the above examples are 32 bit <code>int</code> literals.
A 64 bit <code>long</code> literal has a upper case 'L' or lower case 'l' 
at the end.
However, <b>NEVER</b> use the lower case 'l' because it is easily confused
with a digit '1'.
</p>

<pre class="code">
125L          -32L            16L            0l         -123987l
</pre>
 
<p>
The last two examples are legal, but confusing.
