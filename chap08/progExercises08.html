Chapter 8  Programming Exercises
</h1></center>

<hr />
<p>
If I were a student and saw these exercises I would suspect that they
were "make work" &#8212; the sort of dumb exercises that do little more
than keep the student busy.
Actually, athough these exercises are simple and somewhat tedious,
they are intended to reenforce the concept of <em>primitive data type</em>
which is of crucial importance and well worth a bit of practice at
just this point.
Please do them.
</p>
<hr />

<h2>Exercise 1</h2>
<p>
The following program uses  
primitive data type <code>short</code>:
</p>

<pre>
class ShortEg
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    short value = 32;
    System.out.println("A short: " +  value);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
<code>value</code> in this program is a <em>variable</em>&#8212;a name for a section
of memory that holds data using a particular data type.
In this case <code>value</code> will be the name for 16 bits of main memory that uses
<code>short</code> to represent an integer.
(There is much more about variables in the rest of these notes.)
This program puts the value 32 into <code>value</code>.
Then it writes out:
</p>

<pre>
A short: 32
</pre>

<p>
In other words, the next line of the program examines the variable and writes
out what it finds.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your Job</b><br>  Create a file called <code>ShortEg.java</code>. 
Compile and run it.
Check what it writes onto the screen.
Now edit the program so that the 32 is changed to some other small number,
say 356.
Compile and run the program.
Everything should be fine.
</p>

<p>
Next change the number to 35000 and <u>try</u> to compile and run the program.
This number is too large to work with the data scheme short
(in other words, it cannot be represented in 16 bits using data type <code>short</code>.)
What happens?
</p>

<p>
Now edit the program (don't change the 35000) so that the data type is
<code>int</code>.  Compile and run the program.  Is there a difference?

<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
<p>
The following program uses  
primitive data type <code>double</code>:
</p>

<pre>
class DoubleEg
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    double value = 32;
    System.out.println("A double: " +  value);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Compile and run the program.  Does its output (what it puts on the screen) differ from
the output of the first program in the previous exercise?
In this program,
<code>value</code> is the name for 64 bits that uses the <code>double</code> data type
to represent floating point numbers.
</p>

<p>
It is perfectly OK to use the variable name <code>value</code> for both programs.
The use of names like this is a way for us to describe what we want to
happen in the computer; it does not permanently reserve part of 
computer memory for any particular use.
</p>

<p>
Now try to "break the system."  
Look in the chapter at the chart of primitive
data types and their allowed ranges of value.
Change the "32" to a value that is too big for <code>double</code>.
You may wish to use scientific notation for this.

<h2>Exercise 3</h2>

<p>
The following program also
primitive data type <code>double</code>.
This program computes and writes out the
value of <code>exp( 32 )</code>.
This is the base of natural logarithms "e" raised
to the power 32.
(Don't worry much about this.  The point of the program
is not the math but the floating point numbers.)
</p>

<pre>
class DoubleCrash
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    double value = 32;
    System.out.println("e to the power value: " +  Math.exp( value ) );
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Compile and run the program. 
Does it compile and run correctly?
Now change the 32 to larger and larger numbers until something goes wrong.

<h2>Exercise 4</h2>
<p>
The following program uses  
primitive data type <code>char</code>:
</p>

<pre>
class CharEg
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    char ch = 'A' ;
    System.out.println("A char: " +  ch );
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The variable <code>ch</code> is 16 bits of main memory that uses
a scheme for representing characters.
The character 'A' has be placed in it.
The program will write:
</p>

<pre>
A char: A
</pre>

<p>
Do the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the <code>'A'</code> into <code>'Z'</code> and  compile and run.</li>
<li>Change the <code>'A'</code> into <code>'AA'</code> and try to compile the program.</li>
<li>Change the <code>'A'</code> into <code>' '</code> and compile and run the program.
    <ul><li>Notice carefully: there is a single space between the two ' marks.</li></ul></li>
<li>Change the <code>'A'</code> into <code>''</code> and try to compile.
    <ul><li>Notice carefully: there is no character between the two ' marks.</li></ul></li>
<li>Change the <code>'A'</code> into <code>"A"</code> and try to compile the program.
    <ul><li>(The double quotes " signify a <em>String</em>, which is something
            different from a <em>char</em>).</li></ul></li>
</ul>
