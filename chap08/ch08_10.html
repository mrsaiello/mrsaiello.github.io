<p>
Do you think that the following is legal?
</p>

<pre class="code">
double rats = 8912D ;
</pre>

</div>
<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
Yes.  The 'D' will make the literal a <code>double</code> 
(even though it lacks a decimal point).
However, to avoid confusion, always include a decimal point 
in a floating point literal,
even where it is not required.

<h1>Scientific Notation</h1>
<p>
Either of the following also works:
</p>
<pre class="code">
double rats = 8912 ;
</pre>

<p>
or
</p>

<pre class="code">
double rats = 8912.0 ;
</pre>

<p>
The first statement (above) works, but is "sloppy" coding.
The integer literal must be converted into a double before 
the variable is initialized.
In the second statement the variable is initialized
to the <code>double</code> literal.
</p>

<p>
You will sometimes see <b>scientific notation</b>.
The following are all double-precision literals:
</p>

<pre class="code">
1.23E+02     -1.235E+02      -1.98234234E+05    3.81E-06
</pre>

<form>
<p>
The big "E" means "times 10 to the power of" .
The integer that follows it says what power of ten to multiply the rest
of the number by.
&nbsp;
<input type="button" value="Huh?"
 onClick="alert('Usually scientific notation is taught in high school math and science courses. \n You will not need it (much) in these notes but you will eventually need it in your CS career.')">
</p>
</form>

<p>
Another way of regarding the integer that follows the "E" is that it says
in which direction and for how many places to shift the decimal point.
Positive integers mean right shifts; negative integers mean left shifts.
