<p>
Is <code>Int</code> a primitive data type?
</p>
</div>
<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
No&#8212;it is not on the list of primitive data types (the word that starts with
a small "i" is on the list: <code>int</code>).  Remember that Java
is case sensitive.

<h1>Objects</h1>
<A NAME="data, two kinds"></A>
<p>
Java has <em>very many</em> data types built into it,
and you (as a programmer) can create as many more as you want.
However, all data in Java falls into one of two categories:
<b>primitive data</b> and <b>objects</b>.
There are only the eight primitive data types.
Any data type you invent will be a type of object.

<p>
Much more will be said about objects  future chapters (since Java is a
<em>object oriented</em> programming language).
The following is all you need to know, for now:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A primitive data value uses a small, fixed number of bytes.</li>
<li>There are only eight primitive data types.</li>
<li>A programmer can not create new primitive data types..</li>
<br>
<li>An object is a big block of data.  An object may use many bytes of memory.</li>
<li>An object usually consists of many internal pieces.
<li>The data type of an object is called its <b>class</b>.</li>
<li>Many classes are already defined in the Java Development Kit.</li>
<li>A programmer can create new classes to meet the particular needs of a program.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A (crude) analogy is that a primitive data value is like a nut or a bolt, but an
object is like a whole machine.
If you want to learn more about objects right away, it would not hurt to jump
ahead to the 
<A HREF="..\Chap25\ch25_1.html">Chapter On Objects</A> and read a few
pages.
