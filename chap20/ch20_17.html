<h1> Dice Game</h1>

<a id="dice_game,_example_program"></a>
<p>
Here are the rules for a dice game:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The game consists of several "rounds."</li>
<li>In each round, the computer plays first by throwing two six-sided dice and adding the spots.</li>
<li>The player must now try to beat that sum.</li>
<li>The player may choose to throw two six-sided dice or one 11-sided die (with sides numbered 2-12).</li>
<li>If the player's throw beats the computer, then the player wins the round. Otherwise the computer wins the round.</li>
<li>The game continues until either the player or the computer has won ten rounds.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The player can chose to throw two dice, which randomly select a number 2 through 12,
or to throw the 11-sided die, which also randomly selects a number 2 through 12.
But the distribution of numbers is different for each choice.
</p>

<p>
Here are the first four rounds of a game:
</p>

<pre class="program">
The Computer tosses: 10
Toss 1 eleven-sided die, or 2 six-sided dice (enter 1 or 2)? 1
You throw 1 die and get: 7
You loose the round!
Score: computer 1, you 0

The Computer tosses: 4
Toss 1 eleven-sided die, or 2 six-sided dice (enter 1 or 2)? 2
You throw 2 dice and get: 9
You win the round!
Score: computer 1, you 1

The Computer tosses: 10
Toss 1 eleven-sided die, or 2 six-sided dice (enter 1 or 2)? 1
You throw 1 die and get: 3
You loose the round!
Score: computer 2, you 1

The Computer tosses: 5
Toss 1 eleven-sided die, or 2 six-sided dice (enter 1 or 2)? 2
You throw 2 dice and get: 5
You loose the round!
Score: computer 3, you 1
</pre>

<p>
Eleven-sided dice are hard to find in the real world.
If you want to play this game with physical dice use a twelve-sided or sixteen-sided die
(which do exist, ask any Dungeon Master) and discard rolls other than 2 through 12.
