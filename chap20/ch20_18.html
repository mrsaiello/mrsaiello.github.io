<div class="left">

<p>
What advantage does the computer have in this game?
</p>

<blockquote><span class="green">
The computer's throw must be beaten by the player.
In case of a tie, the computer wins the round.
</span></blockquote>

<div class="right">
<p>
What advantage does the player have in this game?
</p>

<blockquote><span class="green">
The player can select from a uniform distribution (one 11-sided die)
or a non-uniform distribution  (two regular dice) with 6-7-8 as the most common outcomes.
Use the uniform distribution when a high number is needed;
use the non-uniform distribution when 6-7-8 is enough to win a round.
</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="green">
Is this enough to overcome the computer's advantage?
Play the game and see!

details of giving the player a choice of dice and then
throwing that choice.
