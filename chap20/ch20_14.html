<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
Yes.  
The progam can be written without any <code>if</code> statements.
It could use just a single <code>while</code>
statement that tests a fairly complicated boolean expression.
The user would enter each of the three numbers before any are tested.

<h1>Sample Run</h1>
<p>
It would be a fruitful exercise for you to shorten the program as suggested.
Programmers usually continue working on a program after it first meets the
specifications.
Often the program will shrink in size as work continues!
(But a program should not be made shorter at the expense of
simplicity and clarity.)
</p>

<p>
Here is a sample run of our simple and clear program:
</p>

<pre>
Enter first number: 6
Enter second number: 15
Enter third number: 30
Lock does not open

Enter first number: 6
Enter second number: 12
Enter third number: 30
Lock opens
</pre>

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 14:</h3>
<p>
Do actual locks insist that each number be entered <em>exactly</em> correct?
