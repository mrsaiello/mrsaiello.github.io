<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
No.  The range is the same as with two dice, 2 through 12, 
but each of those outcomes is equally likely,
unlike the case with two dice.

<h1>Example Output</h1>

<p>
Here is a sample run of the above (correct) program:
</p>

<pre class="program">
You toss a 11
You toss a 8
You toss a 6
You toss a 5
You toss a 5
You toss a 5
You toss a 6
You toss a 6
You toss a 6
You toss a 12
You toss a 4
You toss a 5 Exception in thread "main" . . .
</pre>

<p>
Here is a sample run of a program that (incorrectly) uses  <code>(rand.nextInt(11)+2)</code>:
</p>

<pre class="program">
You toss a 6
You toss a 10
You toss a 11
You toss a 4
You toss a 6
You toss a 5
You toss a 11
You toss a 9
You toss a 7
You toss a 2
You toss a 4
You toss a 3 Exception in thread "main" . . .
</pre>

<div class="left">
<p>
With such a small sample, you can't tell for sure that something is wrong,
but you might be suspicious.
To confirm your suspicions, gather much more data, then count the number of times each outcome
occurs and check that the results match what you expect.
This is part of what is studied in a probablility and statistics course.
