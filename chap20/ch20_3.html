<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
No.  That would make it too easy for an unauthorized person to
figure out the combination

<h1>Flowchart of the Lock Program</h1>
<A NAME="program, combination lock"></A>

<img src="lockFlowchart.gif" alt="flowchart" />
</center>

<p>
You find out if you have used the correct combination 
only after you have entered all three numbers.
Then,
if the lock fails to open, 
you have to try again from the beginning.
The flowchart shows how the lock works.
</p>

<p>
The flowchart uses a variable <code>correct</code>
that is initialy set to <code>true</code>,
but is set to <code>false</code> as soon as
a wrong number is entered.
It is tested after all three numbers 
have been entered to determine
if the lock is to open,
or not.

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 3:</h3>
<p>
Check the flowchart. Can a user of the program
determine which numbers were incorrect if the
lock does not open?
