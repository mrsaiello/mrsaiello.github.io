<h1>Simple Java Program</h1>
<A NAME="java program, Hello World"></A>
<p>
Here is an example Java program.
It is almost the smallest possible Java program.
When it is run
it writes <em>Hello World!</em> on the computer monitor.
The details will be explained later.
</p>

<pre class="program">
class Hello
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
</pre>

<A NAME="source program"></A>
<p>
This program can be created using a text editor
such as the Notepad editor that comes with Windows.
Details on how to do this will come later.
The important thing for now is to 
understand that it is a text file saved on the hard disk.
The file is named <code>Hello.java</code>.
</p>

<p>
A <b>source program</b> is a text file that contains a program (such as above)
written in a programming language.
Since the file contains characters (stored as bytes) it can not
be directly executed (run) by the computer system.
As a text file, you can
print it, display it on the monitor, 
or alter it with a text editor.
