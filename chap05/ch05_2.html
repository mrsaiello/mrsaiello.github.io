<h1>Obtaining Java</h1>

<p>
To run the current version of Java you need a computer that is running
one of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows XP<sup><small>&#169;</small></sup> </li>
<li>Windows 2000<sup><small>&#169;</small></sup> </li>
<li>most versions of Unix (including Linux and Sun's Solaris)</li>
<li>a recent Apple running a Mac OS.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should also have 250 Megabytes available on your hard drive.
If you have a recent version of Java installed on your computer 
it may be all you need for these notes.
Apple computers and some Linux computers come with Java already installed,
  although it may be an earlier version.
You don't need the very latest version, 
although for these notes you should have Java 5.0 or higher.
</p>

<p>
These notes show Java 5.0 on a typical Windows system.
If you are running some other operating system there will be 
small differences in how you create and run programs,
but no difference in the Java language itself.
