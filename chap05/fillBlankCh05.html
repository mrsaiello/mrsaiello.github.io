<b>Instructions:</b> &nbsp;
This is an ungraded fill-in-the-blank exercise.
Each question consists of a sentence with one or two words left out.
A button represents the missing word(s).
For each question,
think of the word or phrase that should fill each blank,
then click on the buttons to see if you are correct.
No grade is calculated for this exercise.

1. Complete the program so that it writes "Goodbye" on the computer monitor.
<blockquote>
<pre>
class Bye
{  
  public static void main ( String[] args )  
  { 
    System.out.println(" <input type="button" 
value="_____________"                    
name="button1" 
onClick="button1.value='Goodbye'"> ");  
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

</form>

<form>
2. The source file that this program is saved in should be called 

<input type="button" 
value="_____________"                    
name="button1" 
onClick="button1.value='Bye.java'">
(Be sure you use correct upper and lower case characters.)

</form>



<form>
3. The compiler will create a file containing 

<input type="button" 
value="_____________"                    
name="button1" 
onClick="button1.value='bytecodes'">  
.  This file will be named

<input type="button" 
value="_____________"                    
name="button2" 
onClick="button2.value='Bye.class'"> 
.

</form>



<form>
4. The program that interprets the byte codes on your hardware is called the Java 

<input type="button" 
value="_____________"                    
name="button1" 
onClick="button1.value='Virtual Machine'">. 

</form>

<form>
5. Although the underlying hardware may be different,
the Java Virtual Machine
on your computer is 

<input type="button" 
value="_____________"                    
name="button1" 
onClick="button1.value='the same'"> 
as that on any other computer, and so can run the same byte codes.

</form>

<form>
6. An <!-- end FILL -->
<input type="button" 
value="_____________"                    
name="button1" 
onClick="button1.value='applet'"> 
is a Java bytecode program that runs on a Web browser.
