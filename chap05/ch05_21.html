Hopefully this chapter explained just exactly what you needed to know
to run Java programs,
and everything worked out perfectly,
and you can now create Java source programs, 
and compile them into bytecodes,
and execute them using the Java interpreter.
</p>

<p>
Well.... one can hope.
If something was less than perfect,
find a friend that knows more about these things and is
happy to help.
Or, start again and go through everything once again.
Or, move on and come back to this chapter later.
