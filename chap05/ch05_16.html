<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Yes</b> &#8212; Find a Web site that explains basic computer use
    and DOS commands, or find a suitable book in your library.
    You will only need to look at the first one or two chapters.
    Better yet, find a friend that knows all this and is happy to show off.
</li>
<li><b>No</b> &#8212; Good.</li>
</ul>

<div class="lesson">
<h1>Notepad</h1>
<p>
Once Notepad is running, just type in the program.
Here is Notepad with the sample program:
</p>

<center>
<img src="Figure05-6.gif"/> 
</center>

<p>
To enter characters, just type them.
You can move around the text using the mouse or arrow keys.
To delete mistakes, 
use the "backspace" key or the "delete" key.
To start a new line, just hit "Enter".
In typing in the program, you <em>DO</em> have to get
upper and lower case letters, and all punctuation <em>exactly</em>
correct.
You do not have to get the spaces exactly correct.
</p>

<p>
Now you need to save the file to the hard disk.
One of the selections in the menu bar at the top of the Notepad window
is used to do this.
