Usually, however, people do not have hardware Java processors
(although these do exist).
They have ordinary PCs and Apples.
</p>

<p>
Now for the clever part:
the Java processor can be implemented as software!
It is implemented as a program that reads the
bytecodes and performs the operations they specify.
(This type of program is called an interpreter.)
The Java bytecode interpreter is an executable program
that runs on whatever computer system you have.
Here is a picture showing this:

<p>
The "Java interpreter" in the picture is an executable program that is
running on the computer system.
Each type of computer system has its own Java interpreter that can run
on that system.
The "Actual Processor" is the actual, hardware processor chip of that
computer system.
</p>

<blockquote>
(Another) <b>Important Idea:</b> When the Java interpreter is 
running on a computer system, that system acts just 
like a hardware Java bytecode processor.
It is a <em>Java Virtual Machine.</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
Any computer system can execute Java bytecode programs by using
a Java interpreter.
The Java interpreter has to be specifically written for the computer system,
but once that is done, the computer system can become a Java virtual machine.
That is, it looks like a computer with a hardware Java processor chip 
and can run Java bytecodes.
</p>

<p>
When a Java program is translated into bytecodes,
the bytecodes are exactly the same no matter what computer system is used.
This means the bytecodes on a Sun computer can be sent to an Intel
based computer and they will run without a problem.

Say that Apple has just come out with a new computer and wants this computer
to run Java programs. What must Apple do?
