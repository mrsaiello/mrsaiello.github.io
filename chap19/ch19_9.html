<p>
In the above dialog,
the user keeps trying interest rates until one is found
where the account reaches the million dollar goal.
In terms of computer programming,
what is the user doing?

<p>
The user is acting like a result-controlled loop.

<h1>Gradually Increasing the Interest Rate</h1>
<p>
The user is acting like a result-controlled loop.
We can write  the program do this.
Here is an outline of a program that starts the interest 
rate out at zero percent,
then increases it in tenth percent increments
until the million dollar goal is reached:
</p>

<pre class="program">
class  MillionDollarInterestRate
{

  public static void main( String[] args ) 
  {
    double initialAmount = 1000.00 ;
    double dollars = 0.0;
    double rate = -0.001; // This is about to change
 
    while ( dollars &lt; 1000000 )
    {
       // change to the next rate
       rate = rate + 0.001;

       <span class="blue">// compute the dollars after 40 years at the current rate</span>

       <span class="blue">. . . . . .</span>

    }

    System.out.println("After 40 years at " + rate*100 
      + " percent interest you will have " + dollars + " dollars" );
  }

}
</pre>
 
<p>
This <b>is</b> a result controlled loop,
because the loop stops only when the interest rate is found that
gives us the result we want.
The number of times the loop iterates is not
explicit in the program.

<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 9:</h3>
<p>
The skeleton program does not have code for the part that says
"<span class="blue">compute the dollars after 40 years at the current rate</span>."
How do you expect that this will be done?
(Hint: look at the previous version of the program.)
