<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
The completed program is given below.
</p>


</div>

<!-- LESSON DIVISION -->
<div class="lesson">
<h1>Complete Program</h1>
<p>
In completing the program,
be sure that <code>rate</code> is correct.
The user is supposed to enter percent interest, 
for example 6 for six percent.
The program needs to convert that to a rate such as 0.06 to work correctly.
</p>

<pre class="program">
import java.util.Scanner;

class DollarsAfterForty
{

  public static void main( String[] args )  
  {
    double dollars = 1000.00 ;
    double rate;
    int    year =  1 ;     

    // get the interest rate from the user
    Scanner scan = new Scanner( System.in );
    System.out.print("Enter the interest rate in percent: "); 
    rate = scan.nextDouble()/100.0 ;
 
    while (  <span class="blue">year &lt;= 40</span> )
    {
      // add another year's interest
      dollars =  dollars + dollars*<span class="blue">rate</span> ; 

      // add in this year's contribution
      dollars = dollars + 1000 ;

      year    =  year + 1 ;
    }

    System.out.println("After 40 years at " + rate*100 
      + " percent interest you will have " + dollars + " dollars" );
  }

}
</pre>


<p>
Here is an example run:
</p>

<pre>
C:\users\default\JavaLessons\chap19&gt;java DollarsAfterForty
Enter the interest rate in percent: 11
After 40 years at 11.0 percent interest you will have 646826.9337201559 dollars

C:\users\default\JavaLessons\chap19&gt;java DollarsAfterForty
Enter the interest rate in percent: 12
After 40 years at 12.0 percent interest you will have 860142.3907860613 dollars

C:\users\default\JavaLessons\chap19&gt;java DollarsAfterForty
Enter the interest rate in percent: 13
After 40 years at 13.0 percent interest you will have 1146485.7949682677 dollars
</pre>


<p>
It looks like the interest rate should be somewhere between 12 and 13 percent.

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 8:</h3>
<p>
In the above dialog,
the user keeps trying interest rates until one is found
where the account reaches the million dollar goal.
In terms of computer programming,
what is the user doing?
