<p>
Is your car's computer doing input and output?
</p>
</div>
<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
Yes&#8212;data is input from sensors, computations are performed,
and the results are output to devices that control the motor.

<h1>I/O Streams</h1>
<A NAME="input stream"></A>
<A NAME="output stream"></A>
<A NAME="stream, i/o"></A>
<p>
If your car's program were written in Java, 
it would use
a specialized I/O package 
that manages sensors and controllers.  
It would
not use the I/O package that deals with keyboards and terminals.
</p>

<p>
In Java, a source of input data is called an <b>input stream</b>
and the output data is called an <b>output stream</b>.
Think of these streams like this:
</p>

<center>
<img src="IOStreams.gif" vspace="10"   alt="IO streams" />
</center>

<p>
In this picture, each "O" is supposed to be a datum (chunk of data)
waiting in line to be input or leaving as output.
Data input is called <b>reading</b> data,
and data output  data is called <b>writing</b> data
(or <em>printing</em> data if the output stream is connected to
a monitor or a printer.)
</p>

<p>
Think of the input stream as a string of pearls which the
program inputs one at a time, in order.
The output stream is another string of pearls 
(not usually the same pearls as were read in).
Often a program will read several data 
and then combine them somehow to produce one output value.
For example,
the input data might be a list of numbers,
the output data might be their sum.

<h3> QUESTION 3:</h3>
<p>
If the program is a text editor (like Notepad) what are the input
and output data?
