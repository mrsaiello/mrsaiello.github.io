<p>
When a computer program does an <em>input</em> operation,
in which direction does the data flow?
</p>
</div>
<!-- ANSWER DIVISION -->

<div class="answer">
<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
From an outside device <em>into</em> the program.

<h1>I/O</h1>
<p>
Input and output are so common that an abbreviation has
been created: <b>I/O</b> (pronounced eye-oh).
I/O operations are very complicated, both at the software level
and at the electronic level.
Part of the problem is that the way in which data is organized
<u>outside</u> the computer is  different from the way it
is organized <u>inside</u> the computer.
Lots of computation is needed to convert data between its various forms.
Luckily, most of the complication has been hidden inside
methods that your program can use.

<A NAME="package"></A>
<p>
These notes use methods of the class <code>java.util.Scanner</code>
for doing input.
<code>Scanner</code> is new to Java 5.0.
<code>Scanner</code> is not part of the fundamental Java language,
but is part of a package, <code>java.util</code>,
that you can include in your program.
A <b>package</b> is a collection of classes 
which may be used with other programs.
Think of a package as a tool box
and the classes within it as tools.
Different programs need different tools and
include different packages.
</p>

<p>
It may seem odd to you 
that Java itself does not have I/O built into it.
The reason for this is that there are very many types of I/O,
and a language that has all of them built in would be large and
cumbersome.
A language used for professional software development
such as Java (or C or C++ or any of several others)
allows the programmer to pick the right I/O package for the job.

<h3> QUESTION 2:</h3>
<p>
Your automobile has a computer  that controls the motor
as it monitors data from dozens of sensors.
Is this computer doing input and output?
