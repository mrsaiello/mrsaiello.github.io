<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
An executable interpreter consists of
machine instructions,
like all programs that can execute directly on the processor.

<h1>Virtual Machine</h1>
<p>
When an interpreter is running a BASIC source program,
both the interpreter and the source program are in main memory.
The interpreter consists of machine instructions that the hardware
can execute directly.
The BASIC source program consists of commands in the language BASIC
that the interpreter knows.
From the perspective of the BASIC program,
<em>it looks like the commands in BASIC are being directly executed
by some sort of machine.</em>
Here is the figure, modified to show this:
</p>

<img src="Figure4-3.gif" alt="Interpretting a source program on a virtual processor" />
</center>

<A NAME="virtual machine"></A>
<p>
This is really the same as the previous figure, but now
a box has been drawn around the actual (hardware) processor
and the interpreter that it is executing.
The combination "looks like"
a machine that can directly act upon BASIC source
programs.
The word <b>virtual</b> is used in situations where software
has been used to make something look like the real thing.
In this case it looks like we have a machine that can directly
execute BASIC, so we can say that we have a BASIC virtual machine.

<h3> QUESTION 13:</h3>
<p>
Do you think that it would also be possible to use a translator
to translate a BASIC source program into an executable file
(containing machine instructions)?
