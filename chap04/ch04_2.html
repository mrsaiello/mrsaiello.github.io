<h1>Electronic Operations of a Processor</h1>
<A NAME="pentium, picture"></A>
<p>
When a program is running on a computer 
the processor is
constantly performing 
very many, very tiny electronic operations.
For example,
one such operation reads one byte of data
from main memory into the processor.
Another operation  tests if one of the bits
in the byte is a "1" bit.
Most processors are able to perform
several hundred types of small operations like these.
</p>


<p>
Those are the only things that a processor can do.
It has a small set
of tiny electronic operations that it can to perform,
and that is all.
These little electronic operations are performed one at a time.
But millions of them are performed per second.
Millions of small operations
can add up to a large and useful action.
</p>

<p>
Everything that a processor does are
built out of these tiny operations!
Luckily,
you don't need to know these details
to write programs in Java.
The purpose of a "high-level language" like
Java is to organize the tiny electronic operations
into large, useful units represented by program statements.

<h3> QUESTION 2:</h3>
<p>
(Thought question:)
When you click on a hyperlink (such as the next button)
your Web browser (a computer program) finds and displays a new page.
About how many detailed electronic operations does the
processor perform in doing this?
