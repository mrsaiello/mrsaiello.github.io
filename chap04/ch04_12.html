<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
Java.  All the time (and expense) of getting the program to run on
other computers is avoided.
(Actually, the issue is not quite so clear-cut as this.)

<h1>Interpreter</h1>
<A NAME="interpreter"></A>
<p>
Programs written in a high level language are never directly
executed by the processor.
You have already seen one way to execute such a program:
use a translator to create a machine language program that can
be executed directly.
</p>

<p>
Another way to is to use an <b>interpreter</b> for the language.
</P.

<blockquote>
An <b>interpreter</b> is a program that acts like a
processor that can directly execute a high level language.

<p>
This is a fairly complicated thought.
The figure might help:

<A NAME="BASIC"></A>
<p>
In this figure, the source program "program.bas" has been written in BASIC
(a programming language)
by a programmer with a text editor.
It is being interpreted by the BASIC interpreter,
which is running on the processor.
The BASIC interpreter will read each command in the source program
and do what it says.
