<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>
To the source program, where the change is easy to make.
The changed source program is then translated into a new executable program.

<h1>Program Translation</h1>
<p>
Here is a picture that shows what usually happens with programs
written in "C" (Java is different; it will be discussed in the next chapter.)

<p>
Here is a review of what goes on:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The source file is created using a text editor.
    <ul>
    <li>It contains instructions in a high level language.</li>
    <li>It contains bytes that hold characters.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>The source file is kept on the hard disk.</li>
<li>The source file can not be run by the processor.</li>
<li>A translator (compiler) program can translate the source file into an executable file.
    <ul>
    <li>The source file remains unchanged; a new executable file is created.</li>
    <li>A translator is used for programs written in
        a specific high level language (like "C") and
        a specific processor type (like "Pentium"), 
        and only runs under a specific operating system (like "Windows".)</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>The executable file is also kept on hard disk.
<li>To run the program, the operating system is told to copy the executable file
    into main memory and to start it running.</li>
</ol>


<p>
The above is what goes on with most languages: Ada, Pascal, C, C++, FORTRAN and others.
Java adds a few more steps,
which will be discussed in the next chapter.

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 10:</h3>
<p>
A source program has been written in the "C" language.
The file has been copied onto the hard disk of a Pentium-based computer and
onto the hard disk of an Apple Macintosh.
What must now be done so that the program can execute on both computers?
