<div class="lesson">
<h1>Machine Language Program</h1>
<p>
There are at least two sensible programs for the toothbrush.
Here is one program:
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding=4  bgcolor="white" bordercolor="brown">
<tr bgcolor="tan"><th>Address</th><th>Machine Instruction</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>&nbsp;0000 0001 </td><td>Rotate bristles left</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>&nbsp;0000 0010 </td><td>Rotate bristles right</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>&nbsp;0000 1000 </td><td>Skip next instruction if switch is off</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>&nbsp;0000 0100 </td><td>Go back to start of program</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>&nbsp;0000 0000 </td><td>Stop running</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
In the electronic memory of the toothbrush the program is stored as a
sequence of bits:
</p>

<pre>
0000 0001 0000 0010 0000 1000 0000 0100 0000 0000 
</pre>

<p>
The processor starts at the beginning and performs
the action described by each code.
This is,
of course,
a stupid example.
Electric toothbrushes are not controlled by computer processors.
And, the machine instructions of actual processors are much more detailed.
But the essential ideas of the example are these:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A machine language program is a sequence of machine language instructions in main memory.
<li>A machine instruction consists of one or more bytes (in the example, only one.)
<li>The processor runs a program one machine instruction at a time.
<li>All the little machine operations add up to something useful.
</ul>

<p>
If toothbrush user leaves the switch "on" for
a while,
the program repeats its operations many times.
This is how most programs in real computers run--many little
operations add up to a useful function, which is then
repeated many times.

<!-- QUESTION DIVISION -->
<div class="question">
<h3> QUESTION 5:</h3>
<p>
Will the electric toothbruch stop immediately when the switch is turned off?
(Follow through the program to see if this happens.)
