<h1>Different Processors</h1>
<A NAME="processor, differences"></A>
<p>
There are many types of processors used in computer systems.
You probably know something about the most popular ones such as
Intel's processors and the processors used in Apple computers.
A computer system is designed around its processor.
The other electronics are designed for a particular type of
processor.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental difference between (say)
an Apple computer and a PC is the processor each is designed around.
Different processors have different machine operations.
A machine program for a Dell computer (PC)
would make no sense to an Apple computer.
This is why you ordinarily have to be careful to purchase the
correct version of an application for your home computer.
If you buy the a game,
you need to get the version for whatever processor your home computer uses.

<h3> QUESTION 7:</h3>
<p>
(Thought question:) Say that you are looking at two different processor chips.
The first processor has 
twice as many types of machine operations as the second chip.
Is the first processor necessarily the best one?
