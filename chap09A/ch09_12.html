<h1>Assignment Statement Symantics</h1>

<A NAME="symantics"></A>
<p>
The <b>syntax</b> of a programming language says what programs
look like.
It is the grammar of how to arrange the symbols.
The <b>symantics</b> of a programming language says what
the program does as it executes.
It says what the symbols mean.
</p>

<p>
This page explains the symantics of the assignment statement.
An assignment statement asks for the computer to perform
<em>two steps, in order:</em>
</p>

<ol>
<li>Evaluate the expression  (that is: calculate a value.)</li>
<li>Store the value in the variable.</li>
</ol>

<p>
For example, the assignment statement:
</p>

<pre class="code">
sum = 32 + 8 ;
</pre>


<p>
asks for two actions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Evaluate the expression:  <code> 32 + 8 is calculated, yielding 40.</code></li>
<li>Store the value in the variable: <code>40 is placed in sum</code></li>
</ol>

<p>
Note (May, 2002):  I've just spent several hours grading student programs
from second semester computer science.
Several programs were not working
because their authors forgot that
these two steps happen one after the other.
Without this concept, an easy program became difficult.
