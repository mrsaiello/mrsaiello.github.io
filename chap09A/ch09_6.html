<h1>Names for Variables</h1>

<A NAME="variable, names"></A>
<A NAME="identifier, rules"></A>
<p>
The programmer picks a name for each variable in a program.
In addition to variables,
other things in programs
may be given names.
Such a name is called an <b>identifier</b>.
Here are the rules for choosing an identifier:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Use only the characters
   'a' through 'z', 'A' through 'Z', '0' through '9', character '_', and
    character '$'.</li>
    <ul><li>A name can not contain the space character.</li></ul></li>
<li>Do not start with a digit.</li>
<li>A name can be any length.</li>
<li>Upper and lower case count as <u>different</u> characters.
    <ul><li>So &nbsp;<code>SUM</code>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<code>Sum</code>&nbsp;
            are different names.</li></ul></li>
<li>A name can not be a reserved word.</li>
<li>A name must not already be in use in this part of the program.</li>
</ul>
 

<A NAME="reserved word"></A>
<p>
A <b>reserved word</b> is a word which has a predefined meaning in Java.
For example <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>true</code>, 
and <code>import</code> are
reserved words.
Rather than worry about the complete list of reserved words, just remember to
avoid using words that you know already mean something,
and be prepared to make a change if you accidentally use one you didn't know.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of programming style,
a name for a variable usually starts with a lower case letter.
A word that is part of the name starts with an
uppercase letter, unless it is at the start
of the name.
For example, <code>payAmount</code> and <code>grandTotal</code>.
These conventions are not required by syntax,
but are useful to follow since they makes programs
more readable.
