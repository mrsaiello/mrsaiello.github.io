<h3>Answer:</h3>

Multiplication must be shown with a <code>*</code> operator.
(Another answer is that <code>3.14y</code> is not a correct variable name.)

<h1>Spaces Don't Much Matter</h1>
<p>
An expression can be written without using any spaces.
Operators and parentheses are enough to separate the
parts of an expression.
You can use one or more spaces in an expression to visually
separate the parts without changing the meaning.
For example, the following is a correct expression:
</p>

<pre class="code">
(hoursWorked*payRate)-deduction
</pre>


<p>
The following means <em>exactly</em> the same:
</p>

<pre class="code">
(hoursWorked * payRate) - deduction
</pre>


<p>
Use spaces wisely to make it clear what the expression means.
By making things clear,
  you might save yourself hours of debugging.
Spaces can't be placed in the middle of identifiers.
The following is <span style="color:red">NOT</span> correct:
</p>

<pre class="code">
( hours Worked * pay Rate) -deduction
</pre>


<p>
It is possible (but not nice) to be deceptive with spaces.
For example, in the following:
</p>

<pre class="code">
12-4   /   2+2
</pre>


<p>
it looks as if 4 is subtracted from 12, 
and then that the result, 8, is divided by 4.
However, the spaces don't count, and the expression 
is the same as:
</p>

<pre class="code">
12 - 4/2 + 2
</pre>


<p>
This arrangement of spaces makes it clear what the expression
means.
