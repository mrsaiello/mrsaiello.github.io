<p>
Yes. Otherwise it would not be clear what its bits represent.

<h1>Declaration of a Variable</h1>
<p>
Here is a program that uses the variable <code>payAmount</code>.
</p>


<pre class="program">
class Example
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    long payAmount = 123;    <span class="blue">//a declaration of a variable</span>

    System.out.println("The variable contains: " + payAmount );
  }
}
</pre>

<A NAME="declaration"></A>

<p>
The line  &nbsp; <code>long payAmount = 123;</code> &nbsp; is a declaration
of a variable.
A <b>declaration</b> of a variable is where a program
says that it needs a variable.
For our small programs, declaration statements
will be placed between the two braces of the &nbsp;<code>main</code> &nbsp; method.
</p>

<p>
The declaration gives a data type and a name for the variable.
It may also ask that a particular value be placed in the variable.
In a high level language (such as Java)
the programmer does not need to worry about how the computer hardware
actually does what was asked.
If you ask for a variable of type <code>long</code>, you get it.
Details like bytes and memory addresses are up to the Java compiler.
</p>

<p>
In the example program,
the declaration requests a 64 bit section of memory
named <code>payAmount</code>
which uses the primitive data type <code>long</code>.
When the program starts running,
the variable will initially have the value 123 stored in it.
</p>

<p>
A variable cannot be used in a program unless it has been declared.
A variable can be declared only once.

<h3> QUESTION 3:</h3>
<p>
What do you think the program prints on the monitor? (You should be able to figure this out.)
