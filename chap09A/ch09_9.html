<h1>Using Several Lines per Statement</h1>
<p>
You can use several lines for a statement.
Anywhere a space character is OK you can split a statement.
This means you can't split a statement in the middle of a name,
nor between the quote marks of a string literal,
nor in the middle of a numeric literal.
Here is the program with some statements correctly put on two lines:
</p>

<pre class="program">
class Example
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    long   hoursWorked = 40;    
    double payRate = 10.0, 
           taxRate = 0.10;    

    System.out.println("Hours Worked: " + 
hoursWorked );
    System.out.println("pay Amount  : " 
+ (hoursWorked * payRate) );
    System.out.println("tax Amount  : " + (hoursWorked 
* payRate * taxRate) );
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Although correct, the division of statements is confusing to humans.
It is also true that anywhere one space is OK any number of spaces are OK.
Here is a better style for the program:
</p>

<pre class="program">
class Example
{
  public static void main ( String[] args )
  {
    long   hoursWorked = 40;    
    double payRate = 10.0, 
           taxRate = 0.10;    

    System.out.println("Hours Worked: " + 
        hoursWorked );
    System.out.println("pay Amount  : " +
       (hoursWorked * payRate) );
    System.out.println("tax Amount  : " + 
       (hoursWorked * payRate * taxRate) );
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
It is a good idea to indent the second half of a split statement
further than the start of the statement.
