Chapter 15  Programming Exercises</span></h1></center>

<h2>Exercise 1</h2>
<p>
Write a program that asks the user for a starting value
and an ending value and then writes all the integers
(inclusive) between those two values.
</p>

<pre>
Enter Start:
5
Enter End:
9

5
6
7
8
9
</pre>

<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
<p>
Write a program that asks the user to enter a word.
The program will then repeat word for as many times as it has characters:
</p>

<pre>
Enter a word:
Hello

Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
</pre>

<p>
To do this you will need to use the <em>length()</em> method that counts
the number of characters in a string:
</p>


<pre>
String inputString;
int times;

 . . . .

times = inputString.length()
</pre>

<p>

</p>


<hr>
<h2>Exercise 3</h2>
<p>Write a program that asks the user to enter two words.
The  program then prints out both words on one line.
The words will be separated by enought dots so that the total
line length is 30:
</p>

<pre>
Enter first word:
turtle
Enter second word
153

turtle....................153
</pre>

<p>
This could be used as part of an index for a book.
To print out the dots, use <code>System.out.print(".")</code> inside a loop body.
