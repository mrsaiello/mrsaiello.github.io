<h3>Answer:</h3>

<h3>Some Machines that Use Cycles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bicycle &#8212; your legs drive the pedals connected to a gear
    which spins.</li>
<li>CD Player &#8212; the disk spins (cycles) as the laser moves across it.</li>
<li>TV Set &#8212; pictures are put one the screen one after another as long
    as the set is on.</li>
<li>Water Pump &#8212; often a piston repeatedly moves in and out of a cylinder.</li>
<li>Laundry Dryer &#8212; rotating drum.</li>
<li>Clock &#8212; shows the same times every day.  If the clock is mechanical,
    its insides are gears and springs with many mechanical cycles.  If the
    clock is electronic the cycles are still there, but harder to see.</li>
<li>Sun and the Earth &#8212; endlessly cycling, seasons flowing one into the next.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Perhaps the ultimate example of the usefulness of cycles is the ultimate 
machine &#8212; the wheel.

<h1>The <code>while</code> statement</h1>

Here is a  program with a loop:
</p>

<pre class="code">

// Example of a while loop
class LoopExample
{
  public static void main (String[] args ) 
  {
    int count = 1;          // start count out at one
    while ( count &lt;= 3 )    // loop while count is &lt;= 3
    {
      System.out.println( "count is:" + count );
      count = count + 1;    // add one to count
    }
    System.out.println( "Done with the loop" );
  }
}
</pre>
 
<p>
&#160;
</p>

<p>
The flowchart shows how the program works. 
First, <code>count</code> is set to one.
Then it is tested to see if it is less than or equal to three.
</p>

<p>
If the test returns <em>true</em> the two statements in
the block following the <code>while</code> are executed.
The statement <code>count = count + 1</code> increases the
value stored in the variable <code>count</code> by adding one to it.
Then <u>execution goes back</u> to the <code>while</code> statement
and the process is repeated.
</p>

<p>
If the test returns <em>false</em>,
execution goes to the "Done with loop" statment.
Then the program ends.
</p>

<p>
Copy this program to a file and run it.
Then hack upon it. 
See if changing a few things does what you expect.
