<h1>CHAPTER 15 &#8212; Loops</h1>
<A NAME="cycles, usefulness"></A>
<p>
<!-- Audio/chap15-01.mp3 -->
Most modern machines work by endlessly repeating the same motions.
The engine in your car
cycles through the same motions over and over
as it burns gasoline to provide power.
Electric motors are similar. 
They convert
electric power into spinning motion.
Because 
of their circular motions, these machines
keep going as long as you want.
</p>

<p>
Computer programs use cycles, also.
In programming, a cycle is called a <b>loop</b>.
When a program has a loop in it,
some statements are done over and over as long as
is needed to get the work done.
Most computer programs 
execute many millions of program statements each time
they are used.
Usually the same statements are executed many times.
This chapter discusses several kinds of programming loops.
