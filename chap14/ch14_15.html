<h1>Buying on Credit</h1>
<p>
Recall the problem:
</p>

<blockquote>
You would like to buy a new $25,000 red Miata sports car.
To buy the car, you could pay cash for it, or you could buy it
on credit.
</blockquote>

<p>
You might not have $25,000 on hand.
The cookie jar seems to be empty.
No problem &#8212; you can buy on credit, if you qualify.
