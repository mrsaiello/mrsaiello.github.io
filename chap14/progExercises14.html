<h2>Exercise 1 --- Check Charge</h2>
<p>
A bank has the following rule: if a customer has more than $1000 dollars in
their checking account or more than $1500 dollars in their savings account,
then there is no service charge for writing checks.
Otherwise there is a $0.15 charge per check.
Write a program that asks for the balance in each account and then writes
out the service charge.

<h2>Exercise 2  --- Tire Pressure</h2>
<p>
The front tires of a car should both have the same pressure.
Also, the rear tires of a car should both have the same
pressure (but not neccessarily the same pressure as the front tires.)
Write a program that reads in the pressure of the four tires and
writes a message that says if the inflation is OK or not.
</p>


<pre>
Input right front pressure
38
Input left front pressure
38
Input right rear pressure
42
Input left rear pressure
42

Inflation is OK
</pre>

<h2>Exercise 3 --- More Tire Pressure</h2>
<p>
Its not enough that the pressures are the same in the tires,
but the pressures must also be within range.
Modify the program in exercise 1 so that it 
also checks that each tire has a pressure between 35 and 45.
If a tire is out of range, write out an error message immediately,
but continue inputting values and processing them:
</p>

<pre>
Input right front pressure
32
Warning: pressure is out of range

Input left front pressure
32
Warning: pressure is out of range

Input right rear pressure
42
Input left rear pressure
42

Inflation is BAD
</pre>

<p>
If there have been any warnings, write out a final error message.
(To do this, declare a boolean variable <em>goodPressure</em> that
is initialized to <em>true</em> but is changed to <em>false</em>
when an out of range tire is first found.)

<h2>Exercise 4  --- The Pressure is Building</h2>
<p>
Tires don't have to have exactly the same pressure.
Modify the program for exercise 2 so that the front tires can be
within 3 psi of each other, and the rear tires can be within 3 psi
of each other.
</p>

<pre>
Input right front pressure
35
Input left front pressure
37
Input right rear pressure
41
Input left rear pressure
44

Inflation is OK
